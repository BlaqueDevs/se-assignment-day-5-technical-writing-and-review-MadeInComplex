## 1. How can understanding your audienceâ€™s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?

Understanding the audience's expertise level helps tailor the complexity of the information:
- **Tech experts:** Prefer concise, detail-rich explanations with technical jargon.
- **Non-experts:** Need simplified explanations, analogies, and step-by-step instructions.

Adjusting content based on audience expertise ensures clarity and engagement.
